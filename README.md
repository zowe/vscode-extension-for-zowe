# Visual Studio Code Extension for Zowe

The Visual Studio Code (VSC) Extension for Zowe lets you interact with data sets that are stored on IBM z/OS mainframes. You can explore data sets, view their contents, make changes, and upload the changes to the mainframe. Interacting with data sets from VSC can be more convenient than using command-line interfaces or 3270 emulators.

 **Important!** To use the VSC Extension for Zowe, you must install Zowe CLI version **`2.0.0`** or later.

The VSC Extension for Zowe is powered by [Zowe CLI](https://zowe.org/home/). The extension demonstrates the potential for plug-ins powered by Zowe.

**Tip:** For information about how to install the extension from a `VSIX` file and run system tests on the extension, see the [Developer README](./docs/README.md) file that is located in the docs folder of this repository.

## Prerequisites

After you install the Zowe extension, meet the following prerequisites:

* [Install Zowe CLI](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/user-guide/cli-installcli.html#methods-to-install-zowe-cli) on your PC.
  
> **Important!**: To use the VSC Extension for Zowe, you must install Zowe CLI version `2.0.0` or later.

* [Create at least one Zowe CLI 'zosmf' profile](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/user-guide/cli-configuringcli.html#creating-zowe-cli-profiles).

## Configuration and usage tips

You can alter the behavior of the extension in the following ways:

* **Data set Safe Save:** The Visual Studio Code **Save** functionality will overwrite data set contents on the mainframe. To prevent conflicts, use the Zowe extension **Safe Save** functionality to compare changes made with initial mainframe contents before saving. For more information, see [Use Safe Save to prevent merge conflicts](#use-safe-save-to-prevent-merge-conflicts).
* **Data set persistence settings:** You can toggle the persistence of any data sets that are present under your **Favorites** tab.
  
**Tip:** By default, Visual Studio Code does not highlight data set syntax. To enhance the experience of using the extension, download an extension that highlights syntax, such as COBOL.

### Advanced Configuration

> **WARNING**: Specifying these preferences incorrectly, may cause the extension to fail.

Extension preferences can also be modified in the `Settings` for this extension. They can be customized in the following ways:

* **Data set creation settings:** You can change the default creation settings for various data set types.
* **Temp Folder Location:** You can change the default folder location, for where temporary files are stored. In order to set in `Settings`, use the example below.

```json
"Zowe-Temp-Folder-Location": {
    "folderPath": "/path/to/directory"
  }
```
