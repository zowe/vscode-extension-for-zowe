Zowe Explorer is a separately delivered component of Zowe belonging to the [Zowe CLI](https://github.com/zowe/community#zowe-cli) sub-project.  
[Zowe](https://www.zowe.org/) is a project hosted by the [Open Mainframe Project](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/), a [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) project.

The Zowe Explorer extension modernizes the way developers and system administrators interact with z/OS mainframes. Working with data sets and USS files from VSC can be more convenient than using 3270 emulators, and complements your Zowe CLI experience. The extension provides the following benefits:

* Enables you to create, modify, rename, copy, and upload data sets directly to a z/OS mainframe.
* Enables you to create, modify, rename, and upload USS files directly to a z/OS mainframe.
* Provides a more streamlined way to access data sets, uss files and jobs.
* Lets you create, edit, and delete Zowe CLI `zosmf` compatible profiles.
* Lets you use the Secure Credential Store plug-in to store your credentials securely in the settings.

**Note:** The Zowe Explorer is powered by [Zowe CLI](https://zowe.org/home/). The extension demonstrates the potential for plug-ins powered by Zowe.

**Tips:**

* For information about how to install the extension from a `VSIX` file and run system tests on the extension, see the [Developer README](https://github.com/zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe/blob/master/docs/README.md).
* For information about how to develop for Eclipse Theia, see [Theia README](https://github.com/zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe/blob/master/docs/README-Theia.md).
* For information about how to create a VSCode extension for Zowe Explorer (a Zowe Explorer extension) see [VSCode extensions for Zowe Explorer](https://github.com/zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe/blob/master/docs/README-Extending.md).

* Configured TSO/E address space services, z/OS data set and file REST interface, and z/OS jobs REST interface. For more information, see [z/OS Requirements](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/user-guide/systemrequirements-zosmf.html#z-os-requirements).
* Zowe CLI `zosmf` profile.

**Notes:**

* You can use your existing Zowe CLI `zosmf` profiles that are created with the Zowe CLI v.2.0.0 or later.
* Zowe CLI `zosmf` profiles that are created in Zowe Explorer can be interchangeably used in the Zowe CLI.

### Create a Zowe CLI z/OSMF profile

**Follow these steps:**

1. Navigate to the explorer tree.
2. Click the **+** button next to the **DATA SETS**, **USS** or **JOBS** bar.

   **Note:** If you already have a profile, select it from the drop-down menu.
