[Zowe Explorer](https://github.com/zowe/community#zowe-explorer) is a sub-project of Zowe, focusing on modernizing mainframe experience. [Zowe](https://www.zowe.org/) is a project hosted by the [Open Mainframe Project](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/), a [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) project.

The Zowe Explorer extension modernizes the way developers and system administrators interact with z/OS mainframes by:

- Enabling you to create, modify, rename, copy, and upload data sets directly to a z/OS mainframe.
- Enabling you to create, modify, rename, and upload USS files directly to a z/OS mainframe.
- Providing a more streamlined way to access data sets, uss files and jobs.
- Letting you create, edit, and delete Zowe CLI `zosmf` compatible profiles.
- Letting you use the Secure Credential Store plug-in to store your credentials securely in the settings.
- Letting you leverage the API Mediation Layer token-based authentication to access z/OSMF.

## What's new in Zowe Explorer 1.10.0

New features:

- Added base profile support. You can now log in to the API Mediation Layer via Zowe CLI and use that token with a service profile in Zowe Explorer.

For more information, see [Changelog](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/Zowe.vscode-extension-for-zowe/changelog).

## Prerequisites

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v8.0 or later.
- Configure TSO/E address space services, z/OS data set, file REST interface and z/OS jobs REST interface. For more information, see [z/OS Requirements](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/user-guide/systemrequirements-zosmf.html#z-os-requirements).
- Create a Zowe Explorer profile.

## Getting Started

Create a profile, review the sample use cases to familiarize yourself with the capabilities of Zowe Explorer, and you are ready to use Zowe Explorer.

### Create Profile

1. Navigate to the explorer tree.
2. Hover over **DATA SETS**, **USS**, or **JOBS**.
3. Click the **+** icon.
4. Select **Create a New Connection to z/OS**. The user name and password fields are optional before you started to use a profile.
5. Follow the instructions, and enter all required information to complete the profile creation.

![New Connection](docs/images/ZE-newProfiles.gif?raw=true "New Connection")
<br /><br />

You can now use all the functionalities of the extension.

### Use Base Profile and Token with Existing Profiles

Leverage existing base profiles with a token to access z/OSMF via the API Mediation Layer.

Before using the base profile functionality, ensure that you have [Zowe CLI](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/user-guide/cli-installcli.html) v1.13.0 or higher installed.

**Follow these steps:**

1. Open Zowe CLI and run the following command: `zowe auth login apiml`
2. Follow the instructions to complete the login.  
   A local base profile is created that contains your token.  
   **Note:** For more information about the process, see [Token Management](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/user-guide/cli-usingcli.html#how-token-management-works).

3. Run Zowe Explorer and click the **+** icon.

4. Select the profile you use with your base profile with the token.

   The profile appears in the tree and you can now use this profile to access z/OSMF via the API Mediation Layer.

For more information, see [Integrating with API Mediation Layer](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/user-guide/cli-usingcli.html#integrating-with-api-mediation-layer).

- Use the **Add Favorite** feature to permanently store chosen data sets, USS files, and jobs in the **Favorites** folder. Right-click on a data set, USS file or jobs and select **Add Favorite**.

- **Syntax Highlighting:** Zowe Explorer supports syntax highlighting for data sets. Fox example, you can use such extensions as [COBOL Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=broadcomMFD.cobol-language-support) or [HLASM Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=broadcomMFD.hlasm-language-support).
